# MCP Bridge — Connect to MCP Servers

Connect to any MCP server (HTTP or stdio), explore its tools, and create
a dedicated skill for repeated use. MCP servers expose tools via
JSON-RPC.

---

## When to Use

- "Connect to the filesystem MCP server"
- "Use the GitHub MCP server"
- "Create a skill for this MCP tool"
- User mentions MCP or model context protocol

## What is MCP?

MCP (Model Context Protocol) is a standard for exposing tools to AI
agents. Servers provide tools via JSON-RPC over:

- **HTTP** — server running at a URL (e.g., `http://localhost:3001/mcp`)
- **stdio** — server runs as a subprocess via stdin/stdout

## Quick Start

### Step 1: Determine the transport type

Ask the user:
- Is it an HTTP server (has a URL)?
- Is it a stdio server (runs via `npx`, `node`, `python`)?

### Step 2: Test the connection

**For HTTP servers:**

```bash
# List tools
curl -s -X POST <url> \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","method":"tools/list","id":1}'

# With auth
curl -s -X POST <url> \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $API_KEY" \
  -d '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","method":"tools/list","id":1}'
```

**For stdio servers:**

```bash
# Start the server and list tools
echo '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","method":"tools/list","id":1}' | \
  npx -y @modelcontextprotocol/server-filesystem .
```

### Step 3: Explore available tools

```bash
# List all tools
# (use the tools/list method as above)

# Call a specific tool
curl -s -X POST <url> \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","method":"tools/call","params":{"name":"<tool>","arguments":{"arg":"value"}},"id":2}'
```

## Creating a Dedicated Skill

When an MCP server will be used repeatedly, create a dedicated skill:

1. Create `agent/skills/<name>/SKILL.md`
2. Document the server's transport, URL/command, and available tools
3. Include example tool calls with expected inputs/outputs
4. Add auth requirements (env vars, headers)
5. Add to lattice.md index
6. Sync to `.dotagents/skills/<name>/`

### Simple skill (just SKILL.md)

For straightforward servers — document how to use the MCP server
directly.

### Rich skill (SKILL.md + scripts/)

For frequently-used servers — include convenience wrapper scripts
with defaults baked in.

## Common MCP Servers

| Server | Transport | Command/URL |
|--------|-----------|-------------|
| Filesystem | stdio | `npx -y @modelcontextprotocol/server-filesystem <path>` |
| GitHub | stdio | `npx -y @modelcontextprotocol/server-github` |
| Brave Search | stdio | `npx -y @modelcontextprotocol/server-brave-search` |
| Obsidian | HTTP | `http://localhost:3001/mcp` |

## Nix Integration

MCP servers that need Node.js should be available via nixpkgs or
vendored per `agent/foundation.md`:

```nix
# In devShell or runtimeTools
runtimeTools = with pkgs; [
  nodejs
  # MCP servers run via npx — nodejs must be in PATH
];
```

## Troubleshooting

| Problem | Fix |
|---------|-----|
| Cannot connect (HTTP) | Check URL is correct and server is running |
| Cannot connect (stdio) | Check the command works when run directly in terminal |
| Authentication required | Add `--header "Authorization: Bearer KEY"` or `--env "API_KEY=xxx"` |
| Tool call fails | Use `tools/list` to see the expected input schema |
| npx not found | Ensure `nodejs` is in PATH via nix devShell |

## Guardrails

- Always inspect MCP server tools before calling them
- Never pass credentials in plaintext — use `auth-registry` (sops)
- MCP servers may have side effects — understand what tools do before calling
- HTTP servers may be remote — verify the URL is trusted
- stdio servers run locally — check the command for safety

- `auth-registry` — for storing API keys used by MCP servers
- `skill-author` — for creating the dedicated skill
