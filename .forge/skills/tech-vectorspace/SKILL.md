# tech-vectorspace — Pipeline Sheaf over a Tech Basis

## Basis Vectors (S)

The fundamental tech building blocks for the DASL infrastructure:

| Symbol | Basis Vector eₛ | Role |
|--------|-----------------|------|
| crates.io/getnora.io | e₁ | Package registry (nora as self-hosted) |
| git | e₂ | Source control, lineage, content-addressing |
| flake.nix | e₃ | Reproducible builds, dependency pinning |
| system-manager | e₄ | Declarative systemd deployment |
| nginx | e₅ | Reverse proxy, routing, TLS termination |
| shmem | e₆ | Shared memory IPC, IPLD CAR pages |
| perf | e₇ | Performance profiling, eBPF monitoring |
| cargo/bun/uv | e₈ | Language-level build/packaging (Rust/JS/Python) |

## Free Vector Space V = ℝ⁸

Each pipeline/stack is a point v ∈ V with coordinates (α₁, ..., α₈) indicating
how strongly each tech participates.

## Linear Functionals (Role Projections)

| Functional | Formula | Role |
|-----------|---------|------|
| β (build) | α₃ + α₈ + α₁ | Build & packaging |
| δ (deploy) | α₄ + α₅ | Deployment & ops |
| σ (source) | α₂ | Source & lineage |
| ρ (runtime) | α₆ | IPC & shared memory |
| π (perf) | α₇ | Observability |

## Example Stack Vectors

**Minimal dev stack:**
v_dev = 1·e₂ + 1·e₃ + 1·e₈  →  β=3, δ=0, σ=1

**Ops-heavy stack:**
v_ops = 1·e₄ + 1·e₅ + 0.5·e₇  →  β=0, δ=2, π=0.5

**Registry-centric (Nora):**
v_registry = 1·e₁ + 0.7·e₈ + 0.3·e₂  →  β=2, σ=0.3

**DASL diagonalize tile stack:**
v_tile = 0.3·e₁ + 1·e₂ + 1·e₃ + 1·e₄ + 1·e₅ + 0.5·e₆ + 0.2·e₇ + 0.5·e₈

## Topology τ on V

For each basis element s ∈ S, define the support-open:
  U_s = { v ∈ V | coordinate of v along s ≠ 0 }

These generate a topology τ: finite intersections and arbitrary unions of U_s.
Opens are "regions where certain tools are active."

## Pipeline Phase Subspaces

| Phase p | Subspace V_p = span(S_p) | Tools |
|---------|--------------------------|-------|
| spec | {e₂, e₁} | git, nora |
| code | {e₂, e₈} | git, cargo/bun/uv |
| compile | {e₃, e₈} | flake.nix, cargo/bun/uv |
| debug | {e₂, e₆} | git, shmem |
| perf | {e₇, e₅, e₆} | perf, nginx, shmem |
| fuzz | {e₈, e₆} | cargo/bun/uv, shmem |

## Sheaf Gluing via CID/DAG-CBOR

Define a presheaf F on (V, τ):
- To each open U ⊆ V, assign IPLD DAGs built from phase artifacts
- Gluing condition: on V_p ∩ V_q, artifacts share CIDs or are linked by CID edges

### CID Links Between Phases

```
spec ──CID──→ code ──CID──→ compile ──CID──→ debug
  │                                       │
  └─────────────CID───────────────────────→ perf
                                           │
                                           └──CID──→ fuzz
```

## Tiles/Views

Each tile is a vector subspace V_p equipped with its IPLD/DAG-CBOR representation.
Views are rendered by querying the diagonalize tile server API:

```bash
# View phase distribution
curl -s 'https://solana.solfunmeme.com/tile/diagonalize/api/pivot?by=category' | jq .

# View by depth (≈ layer in the sheaf)
curl -s 'https://solana.solfunmeme.com/tile/diagonalize/api/pivot?by=depth' | jq .

# View full stats
curl -s https://solana.solfunmeme.com/tile/diagonalize/api/stats | jq .
```

## Metric / Cosine Similarity

For stacks v, w ∈ V, define inner product:
  ⟨v, w⟩ = Σₛ vₛ · wₛ · mₛ

where mₛ are "affinity weights" encoding how closely tools relate:
- m(flake.nix, cargo) = 0.9 (tight coupling)
- m(nginx, shmem) = 0.3 (weak coupling)
- m(git, shmem) = 0.5 (CID-content addressing)

Then cos(v, w) = ⟨v,w⟩ / (∥v∥∥w∥) measures stack similarity.

## Integration with Existing Skills

- `diagonalize-tile`: Query the tile API for pivot tables and stats
- `dasl-tiles`: Load tiles via IPLD CAR shmem
- `nix-flakes`: Build and deploy stacks
- `ipld-car-shmem`: Direct CAR page operations
- `dasl-testing`: Fuzz campaigns across implementations
